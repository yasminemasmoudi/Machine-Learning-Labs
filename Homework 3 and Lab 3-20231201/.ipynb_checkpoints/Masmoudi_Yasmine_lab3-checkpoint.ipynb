    "\n",
    "In this laboratory we will use the k-means algorithm to cluster a dataset of 3D points. We will apply **K-means** to the problem of image compression and image segmentation. The main idea is to apply k-means to the colors of the pixels of an image to select the k most representative colors. Then, we will replace each pixel color with the closest representative color. This will allow us to reduce the number of colors in the image and compress it. A color is a vector of 3 values (R,G,B) that represent the amount of red, green and blue in the color; this implies that each pixel is a point in a 3D space.\n",
